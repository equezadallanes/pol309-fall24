## Purpose

This assignment will help you engage more deeply with the readings for a specific topic in political psychology and practice leadership skills by leading others in a semi-structured discussion. 


## Task

For the week where you will serve as discussion leader, you must read ahead of time and prepare questions about the readings. The set of questions you bring to class should both ask about what the readings say but also about how we might apply them to current events. The questions can also challenge something in the readings.


## Criteria for Success

A successful discussion leader will:

1. Ask open-ended questions
2. Demonstrate knowledge of the material assigned
3. Listen attentively to students' answers and ask follow-up questions if necessary
4. Guide the discussion so every student has a chance to participate
