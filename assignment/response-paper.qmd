## Purpose

This assignment will help you think more deeply about a specific topic in political psychology and make connections between different readings.


## Task

You will write a response paper (2 double-spaced pages, 12-point font) where you integrate the readings for a given topic. In the response paper, you will highlight the connections between the readings, write about their applicability to politics today, and offer a critique of the readings as a whole. You may choose to focus more on applicability to today or a critique of existing research. Make sure to strike a good balance between summarizing the readings and finding the connections between them.



## Criteria for Success

A successful essay will:

1. Briefly summarize each of the readings
2. Highlight connections between readings
3. Discuss how the readings apply to our understanding of current events
4. Have a coherent structure and no grammar errors.
